  <h1>10 Tips for Better Home Cooking</h1>
  <p class="meta">Best practices that make every meal better</p>

  <div class="article">
    <p>You don't need fancy equipment or culinary school to cook great food. Most of what separates a mediocre home cook from a confident one comes down to a handful of habits. Here are ten that will immediately improve your cooking.</p>

    <h2>The Tips</h2>

    <h3>1. Read the entire recipe before you start</h3>
    <p>This sounds obvious but almost nobody does it. Reading ahead prevents surprises like a 4-hour marination step buried in step 3, or realizing you don't own a food processor halfway through. Spend two minutes reading. Save yourself twenty minutes of panic.</p>

    <h3>2. Prep everything before you turn on the heat</h3>
    <p>The French call it mise en place - everything in its place. Chop your onions, measure your spices, open your cans. Once heat is involved, things move fast. Having everything ready means you're cooking, not scrambling.</p>

    <h3>3. Season in layers, not all at once</h3>
    <p>Add a pinch of salt when you saut&eacute; the onions. Another when you add the tomatoes. Taste and adjust at the end. Layered seasoning builds depth. Dumping all your salt at the end just makes food salty.</p>

    <h3>4. Let your pan get hot before adding food</h3>
    <p>A cold pan is the enemy of flavor. Meat won't sear, vegetables will steam instead of caramelize, and everything sticks. Heat your pan over medium-high for a minute or two. Add oil, wait until it shimmers, then cook. The sizzle when food hits the pan should be loud and confident.</p>

    <h3>5. Stop overcrowding the pan</h3>
    <p>When you pile too much food into a pan, the temperature drops and moisture gets trapped. Instead of browning, your food steams and turns gray. Cook in batches if you need to. Give each piece of food its personal space. The browning is worth the extra five minutes.</p>

    <h3>6. Taste as you go</h3>
    <p>Your most important kitchen tool is a spoon and your own palate. Taste your food at every stage. Does it need salt? Acid? More time? You can't fix what you can't identify, and you can't identify problems without tasting. Keep a spoon nearby and use it constantly.</p>

    <h3>7. Rest your meat after cooking</h3>
    <p>When meat cooks, the juices get pushed to the center. If you cut into it immediately, those juices run out onto your cutting board. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes (depending on size) and the juices redistribute throughout. The difference between a juicy steak and a dry one is often just patience.</p>

    <h3>8. Use acid to brighten flavors</h3>
    <p>If a dish tastes flat or dull, it probably needs acid, not more salt. A squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of vinegar, or a spoonful of tomato paste can transform a heavy dish into something vibrant. Add it at the end, a little at a time, and taste after each addition.</p>

    <h3>9. Invest in a sharp knife</h3>
    <p>A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because it requires more force and is more likely to slip. A sharp knife makes prep work faster, more precise, and more enjoyable. You don't need an expensive knife - you need a sharp one. Get a basic whetstone or honing steel and learn to use it.</p>

    <h3>10. Clean as you go</h3>
    <p>The best cooks don't end up with a destroyed kitchen. While something simmers or roasts, wash a cutting board, wipe down the counter, put away ingredients. By the time the food is ready, your kitchen is mostly clean. Cooking and cleaning in parallel is a habit that makes the whole process more pleasant.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>None of these tips require talent or special equipment. They're habits. Start with one or two, practice until they're automatic, then add more. In a few weeks, you'll notice that everything you cook tastes a little better - and the process feels a lot less stressful.</p>
